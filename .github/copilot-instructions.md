This project is a Python app that:
- Accepts any sound file (mp4a, wav, etc.)
- Lets the user enter a title in a textbox
- Uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe audio
- Saves the transcription as title, datetime, and '-transcription'
- Uses OpenAI API (gpt-4o) to create notes from the transcription
- Saves notes as title, datetime, and '-notes'
- Has a simple GUI for file selection and title entry

Ensure code is modular, robust, and user-friendly. Use best practices for file handling and API calls.
